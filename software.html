                                             <p class="research-intro">
                                                <p>The <strong>BONME</strong> R package implements the Block-wise Overlapping Noisy Matrix Embedding (BONME) method, designed for integrating and analyzing multi-source electronic health record (EHR) data. This package provides a robust framework for handling block-wise missingness in data, ensuring efficient completion of missing submatrices and enabling comprehensive EHR analysis across multiple sources.</p>

                                            
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li><strong>Multi-Source Data Integration:</strong> BONME addresses the challenge of combining multiple, heterogeneous EHR datasets, where data may have overlapping but non-identical entries. It integrates diverse medical data sources (e.g., from different hospitals or countries) to create a unified dataset for further analysis.</li>
                                            
                                                    <li><strong>Block-wise Matrix Completion:</strong> The package excels in completing block-wise missing data patterns common in multi-institutional EHR datasets. It uses low-rank matrix completion techniques to estimate missing blocks, leveraging overlapping data between different sources to fill in the gaps efficiently.</li>
                                            
                                                    <li><strong>Noise-Resilient Algorithms:</strong> BONME incorporates noise-handling mechanisms to ensure accurate matrix completion even in the presence of noisy or corrupted data entries, which is typical in large-scale EHR data collected from different healthcare systems.</li>
                                            
                                                    <li><strong>EHR Data Integration:</strong> By integrating EHR data from different institutions and formats, BONME helps healthcare researchers and analysts construct comprehensive knowledge graphs or disease networks. It allows for the identification of relationships between medical concepts, improving disease phenotyping and prediction tasks.</li>
                                                </ul>
